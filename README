* fetch-kifu
* a simple binary utilty that fetches a random baduk game record from gokifu.com

I made this program to build something in golang and learn the language. But
I ended up using this little program to get a game to watch, so maybe
someone else will find it useful to.

Well, and i think it's just [[neat][https://youtu.be/PAAkCSZUG1c?t=12s]] that there's go
game sofware made in go language.

If you happen to have a golang compiler on your machine and want to build it
yourself, just run the following command in the cloned repo:

#+BEGIN_CODE
go install main.go
#+END_CODE

If you don't have a go compiler but want to, head
[[here][https://golang.org]] and get one.

If you just want the binary that fetches games - it's there, built for
windows/linux/mac.

The source code is heavily commented, and i tried to cram as much features
and useful syntactic sugar as possible - a potential reference to anyone
learning the language.

I'm learning it myself right now, so i would love any comments on the code.
